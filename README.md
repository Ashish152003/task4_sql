# Task 4: Aggregate Functions and Grouping (SQL Developer Internship)

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Practice using aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MAX`, etc.) and grouping (`GROUP BY`, `HAVING`) to summarize data.

## ðŸ—ƒ Schema Used
Table: `employees`
- `emp_id` (Primary Key)
- `name`
- `dept_id`
- `department`
- `salary`

## ðŸ“Š Sample Queries
- Total/Avg/Max salary by department
- Count of employees per department
- Departments with more than 2 employees
- Count of unique departments
- Group by multiple columns

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts
- Aggregate Functions
- `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- Multi-column grouping
- `DISTINCT` and `ROUND()`

## âœ… How to Run
Import this SQL file into MySQL Workbench or DB Browser for SQLite. Run queries one-by-one to see results.
